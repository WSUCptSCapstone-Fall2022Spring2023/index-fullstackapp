INDEx Full Stack App

## Project summary

 As a nonprofit staffed by volunteers, INDEx doesnâ€™t have the means of hiring/supporting a web developer. We are giving them a hand by providing a easily maintainable website, even with no coding experience. 

### Additional information about the project

INDEx currently only has a small reference to their organization on their parent companies website (dacnw.org). INDEx plans on extending this reference to an entirely new website hosted under their own domain name. This means developing a website and making minor edits to the existing reference.
