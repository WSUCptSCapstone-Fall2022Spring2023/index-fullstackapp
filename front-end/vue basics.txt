9 (some other notes on files inside vue app)
* Note the readme inside the folder

* package.json It holds metadata relevant to the project and it is used for managing
the project's dependencies, scripts, version etc...

*main.js this simply creates the app
* App.vue and HelloWorld.vue, there are some strange things going on so heres a brief intro
notice the open and close tags

<template>         this is where html code goes       </template> "for template syntax theres a vue twist: https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html"

<script>           this is where js code goes         </script>

<style scoped>     this is where css code goes        </style>

This formatt is great and you can read more about component-based programming model
