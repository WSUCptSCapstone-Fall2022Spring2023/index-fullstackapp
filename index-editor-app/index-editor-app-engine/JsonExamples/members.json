      "bioDescription": "DAC NW is excited to add Jolene to our staff. She brings plenty of experience with her. She has been living with multiple diagnosis for the past 8 years and brings her experience with peer support, independent living skills, and assistive technology from the LC Valley Adult Resource Center. She loves the tremendous sense of community you can build at a Center for Independent Living. Community has given her a family she never knew she needed, a great support network, and the ability to give back. These things can improve your self-worth. Jolene understands the value of not allowing anyone to silence you, especially about things that matter. Sometimes one person standing up is all it takes for others to do the same.",
