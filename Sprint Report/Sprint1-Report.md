# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Navigation bar to redirect to Home, About us, Get Involved, Contact, Resources, Services and Events

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For Sprint 1, we spent most of the time working on documentation (team inventory, project description, requirement and specification, solution approach) and try to be in touch with the client. We had a hard time catching up with the documentation since we couldn't effectively communicate with the client but we finally caught up. We have set up an AWS S3 server and have the website, with some skeleton codes, up and running.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We did a good job setting up AWS S3 server
  * We did a good job on the quality of documentation
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * We were very late with the assignments,we want to get all of the documents done in time
   * We had a few problems with braching/merging on Github since fews of us are not familiar with it yet, we'd like to get to know it more and be comfortable with it as we go.
   
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Complete UI for the website's Homepage.
   * Some skeleton codes for the Winform app.
