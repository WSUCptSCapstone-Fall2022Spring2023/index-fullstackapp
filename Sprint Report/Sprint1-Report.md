## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For Sprint 1, we spent most of the time working on documentation (team inventory, project description, requirement and specification, solution approach) and try to be in touch with the client. We had a hard time catching up with the documentation since we couldn't effectively communicate with the client but we finally caught up. We have set up an AWS S3 server and have the website, with some skeleton codes, up and running.
