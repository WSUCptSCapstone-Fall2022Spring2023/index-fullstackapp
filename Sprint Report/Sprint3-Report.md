# Sprint x Report (10/09/2022 - 11/09/2022)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Website's Event Page
 * Website's Event Page mobile compatibility

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For Sprint 3, we spent most time around the Event Page (both website and winform app). We made sure they work with each other,the winform app pushes the events and the website displays them. Vue Router, which helps redirecting to different pages on the website without refreshing) was also added.

## Unfinished Work
We have done all the works listed to be done in the last sprint.
