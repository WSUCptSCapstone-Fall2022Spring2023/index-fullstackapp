# Sprint x Report (10/09/2022 - 11/09/2022)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Website's Homepage
 * Website mobile compatibility
 * Editor app events page functionality and UI

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For sprint 2 we worked on events and UI. The website homepage is complete and has mobile support. On the backend, the editor app now supports updating the website events page. The editor app user can delete, edit and create events. Trying to push the events to the website triggers validations which check for basic missing information or small gramatical problems. 

## Unfinished Work
We haven't finished adding router to Vue app because we didn't expect it would take much more time for other issues.
